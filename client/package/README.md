# Package Booking Functionality

## Overview
The package booking system allows users to book health packages with pre-filled patient information.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Package Display
- Shows available health packages (Cardiology, Pulmonology, Full Body Check)
- Each package displays features, pricing, and booking button

### 2. Booking Modal
- Opens when "Book Package" button is clicked
- Pre-fills patient information from database
- Includes package name (read-only)
- Date picker with minimum date set to tomorrow
- Time slot selection
- Medical history and emergency contact fields

### 3. Patient Information Pre-filling
- Fetches user profile from `/api/user/profile/` endpoint
- Pre-fills: Full Name, Age, Phone, Email, Address
- Gracefully handles API errors without breaking modal

### 4. Form Validation
- Required fields validation
- Date validation (minimum tomorrow)
- Form submission with error handling

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/user/profile/` - Fetch patient information
- `POST /api/packages/purchase/` - Submit package booking

## Debugging
- Console logs added for troubleshooting
- Error handling for API failures
- Modal display verification

## Testing
1. Open `package.html` in browser
2. Click "Book Package" on any package
3. Verify modal opens with pre-filled patient data
4. Check console for debugging information

## Files Modified
